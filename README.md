The task
----------
[Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage)

### Objective
Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to [this](https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/YqLyXB)

### Rules
* Use whichever libraries or APIs you need

### User stories
* I can access all of the portfolio webpage's content just by scrolling
* I can click different buttons that will take me to the portfolio creator's different social media pages
* I can see thumbnail images of different projects the portfolio creator has built
* I can navigate to different sections of the webpage by clicking buttons in the navigation

### Hints
* Using Bootstrap can help make this process much easier for you.
* Note that CodePen.io overrides the `window.open()` function, so if you want to open windows using jQuery, 
  you will need to target invisible anchor elements like this one: `<a target='_blank'>`


Built with
----------
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com) &#8212; a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library
* [SASS](http://sass-lang.com) &#8212; the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension
  language in the world
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) &#8212; the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing
  responsive, mobile first projects on the web
